# Bird-Species-Observation-Analysis
The project aims to analyze and monitor bird populations across different habitats, specifically forests and grasslands. Tracking species diversity is essential for conservation efforts, as it helps understand the impact of environmental factors such as climate, habitat conditions, and human disturbances. Changes in temperature, humidity, and habitat alterations can significantly influence bird behavior, migration patterns, and population density.

One of the major challenges in this study is handling large datasets collected from multiple sources. The data is complex, spread across different formats, and requires proper cleaning and structuring to extract meaningful insights. Traditional analysis methods make it difficult to visualize trends effectively.

To address these challenges, an interactive dashboard is developed using Streamlit and Plotly. This dashboard enables users to dynamically explore bird observation data, analyze seasonal trends, study spatial distribution, and identify species affected by environmental factors. It simplifies data interpretation and supports informed decision-making for conservation planning.
